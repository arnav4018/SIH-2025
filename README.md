# Agricultural Monitoring Dashboard - SIH 2025

## Overview
This project is an advanced agricultural monitoring system that combines IoT sensors, AI/ML models, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to monitor crop health and environmental conditions in real-time.

## Team Structure & Responsibilities
- **Frontend** (Arnav & Radhika): Streamlit dashboard, MATLAB App Designer UI and presentation assets
- **Backend** (Suryansh): Core orchestration and integration logic
- **AI/ML** (Aryan): Image analysis models and stress prediction algorithms  
- **Data Management** (Neha): Dataset preparation and processing
- **IoT** (Harshit): Sensor device code and data collection

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Quick Launch (Recommended)
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SIH-2025
   ```

2. **Run the dashboard**
   ```bash
   # Double-click start_dashboard.bat or run from command line
   start_dashboard.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. **Setup Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv agri_dashboard_env
   agri_dashboard_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch dashboard**
   ```bash
   # Basic dashboard
   streamlit run frontend/app.py
   
   # Enhanced dashboard (recommended)
   streamlit run frontend/app_enhanced.py
   ```

3. **Access the dashboard**
   - Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

## Development Setup
1. Each team member should work in their designated folder
2. Create a feature branch for new work: `git checkout -b [name]/[feature]`
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Submit pull requests for review before merging to main

## Current Status
âœ… **Dashboard Operational** - Interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time monitoring
âœ… **Frontend Structure** - Organized frontend files with proper configuration
âœ… **Environment Setup** - Python virtual environment and dependencies configured
ðŸ”„ **Integration in Progress** - Backend and AI model integration

## Key Integration Points
- **JSON Data Contract**: All team members must agree on data formats between IoT â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend
- **Stub Functions**: Backend stubs enable parallel development while AI models are being developed
- **Git Workflow**: Use feature branches and pull requests to avoid merge conflicts

## Next Steps
1. Suryansh: Create stub functions in `/backend/stubs/`
2. Harshit: Define IoT sensor data JSON format  
3. All team members: Agree on data contracts and interfaces
4. Begin parallel development in assigned folders
