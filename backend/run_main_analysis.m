    %RUN_MAIN_ANALYSIS Main agricultural analysis function
    %   This function performs agricultural analysis and returns:
    %   - health_map: A 3D array representing the crop health visualization
    %   - alert_message: String containing any alerts or warnings
    %

    %   for testing the Streamlit dashboard integration.
